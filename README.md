# Taxi Fare Prediction based on Weather Condition
Predicting online taxi fares based on weather condition usisng regression machine learning model

**Tools Used** : Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn

**Category** : Machine Learning, Regression

**Year** : August 2021

**Features** : timestamp, hour, day, month, cab_type, temperature, visibility, destination, distance, price, daylight hours

**Model Algorithm** : Linear Regression

**Result** : In feature engineering process, we found that the weather has no significant correlation with the taxi fare. Then the features that included in the model training precess are cab type, distance and surge multiplier. After the evaluation on data test, the model got 99% accuracy, MAE score of 4.6 and RMSE score of 14.1
